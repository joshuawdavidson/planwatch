<br />
1. set up a secret word on your user settings page (it's the last option)<br />
<br />
2. send to that email address when you want to post a plan. you can change your secret word as often as you like.<br />
<br />
email posts support multipart mime messages (like from webmail clients or whatever), preferring the html version over the plaintext version where available.<br />
<br />
eventually, i'll figure out what i ought to be doing with attachments. for now, they just get dumped.<br />
<br />
the following keywords work in the subject line:<br />
<br />
<b>nofeed</b> prevents the post from appearing in the rss version of your plan (this would, for instance, keep it off facebook if you have planwatch/facebook integration set up)<br />
<br />
<b>private</b> marks the post as a private entry, viewable only to your allowed list<br />
<br />
<b>formatted</b> prevents planwatch from adding extra linebreaks when processing your complicated html-in-plaintext posts. probably not all that useful in most cases. you get this automatically in real rich-text html email posts.<br />
<br />
<b>markdown</b> tells planwatch to apply markdown formatting to your post<br />
<br />
other stuff from the subject line gets stored with your post as comments, so this is a good place to put keywords or hashtags or what-have-you if you habitually search your archives.<br />
<br />
<br />
in all other respects, mail-posted entries are just normal entries. if you want things to work a little differently, or you have questions, send or email me. i'm happy to help as i have time.";
