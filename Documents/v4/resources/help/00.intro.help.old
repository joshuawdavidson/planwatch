<!--
To register click on the register link at the top of the page.
Follow the instructions.  Some of the text in the form boxes have 
word bubbles if you hover over them with the mouse to help you along the 
way.  Select the radio button marked 'planwatch.org' if you want your plan to be hosted here.

[If you're an Amherst student, you can just enter your username, and planwatch.org will automagically
get your Vax plan. When the Vax is decommissioned, planwatch.org will move the pointer to your Amherst NOTE plan.]

<br><br>

If you're getting a local plan, for ease, I would select journaling 
for plan format.  Any password is fine.  Make your plan at least public for 
now.  It might be a little early to make your plan advertised but don't make 
it private either.  And be honest and put your real name and email.  I 
assure you, Josh does not have the time to send you junk mail.
<br>
[note from josh: really, i don't. i have waaaay too much to do. the email field
is just there so if we need to contact you about your account, we can. and we won't
give it out either. all your user info is private unless you make it public on your plan).]

<br><br>
(About the plan names: Planworld names are simple and concise. Traditionally,
your user name should be your first initial followed by your second initial
followed by your entire last name. My name is Devin Scott Roark, therefore my
planworld name is dsroark. Follow that format and it'll be fine.)

<br><br>
Once you do all that you can fill in your <a href='/edit/bio'>bio</a>,
<a href='/write/header'>header</a>, <a href='/write/footer'>footer</a>, and
<a href='/write/divider'>divider</a>.
All of these are optional but helpful to the readers of your plan.  Bios 
work like AIM: just write any damn statement about yourself you want.  Your 
header is the first thing anyone fingering (clicking on) your plan will 
read.  It can be boring (like mine) or witty (sorta like jwdavidson's 
[thanks, dev]).
Whatever you want.  Your footer is the last thing on the plan.  Most people 
use the footer for contact information or quotes.  For now don't touch the 
divider; what Josh has there is fine in order to start planwriting. 
[ If you want to change it later, you can always edit it. And if you
don't like the date formatting, there's help on how to change it. ]

Hit the submit button and you're on your way.
<br><br>

Now you can log in and start this thing.
Just click on a name and read the stuff.  It's all sorted out so that you 
don't have to hit the back button, so you can keep shifting through the 
plans.

<br><br>
After a while, there are naturally going to be a few plans you really like 
reading and a few you won't care for as much (or even absolutely despise, 
which is something different).  In either case, you can sort them all out 
with the watched list.  The watched list is a grouping of the plans you 
read.  Hit the tools button (the small hammer icon) and then hit 'edit your
watched list'.  In the form box you can write the name of the plan you 
want in the list and press enter(return) to write another one and so forth.  
As long as you don't misspell the plan name it will show up in your watched 
list each time you log on.  Personally I hope dsroark will end up on there 
eventually, but just as long as you don't put in smroark, it's all good :).

<br><br>
[ you can also just click the 'watch' link that appears
above the plan you're currently reading. ]

<br><br>
To write your plan (the real meat of planworld) hit the write icon (the 
small box with a pencil).  There then appears a box in which you can write 
whatever comes to your mind for as long as you want however you want to say 
it.  Profanity is allowed.  <a href='/read/lhing'>lhing</a> is probably the
best example of this.
Reading her will give you an idea of just how far you can go, given your 
expectations.  In any case, you can put anything.  That's the magic of 
planworld: there are no limits.  Whatever you write about has no relevance 
to the things other people write about unless that fancies _you_.  People 
will still read your plan if you write completely random stuff, and you can 
reference other plans if you decide to; however, you're not required to do 
so.  
[ if you do reference other people's plans, it's best to use their planwatch name
between exclamation points (such as !dsroark!) to do so. you don't have to, but
if you do then people reading your plan will get a link to their plan, and the person
you reference will know you're saying something to or about them. your readers can just
click the link to read the plan you're referencing. so it's handy, but no one
will stop you from doing whatever the hell you want. ]

There is no theme to anything.  So experiment.  Write about your day.  
Write about a movie you saw.  Write about your campaign session.  Write 
about your hatred towards tasteless tongue depressers.  
[ some of my favorite plans are of a more personal or positive nature, but you weren't
really trying to impress me, were you? ]
Whatever, as long as it is genuinely you, we'll read it.
<br><br>
Another cool feature of planworld is snitch [ and now snoop, snitch's cousin ]. 
When logged on, you can click 
on the eye icon and see who's been reading your plan.  It's a great tool to 
see a multitude of things - How interesting you are, whether people have read 
your important plan update, if that person you hate's been reading your 
plan, etc. [ if there's someone you really don't want reading your plan, you
can always block them. and you can make individual entries private by clicking
the 'private' box when you update -- private entries are like private plans: only
the people on your allowed list can read them. ]  You don't have to set anything up
for snitch, it's automatically there when you register.  You just have to start writing
(ack, now i'm beginning to sound like a cheezy salesperson).
[ you can also turn off snitch if you want. when snitch is off, you won't know who's reading you,
and people you read won't know when you read them. ]

<br><br>
This is long, I know (and I warned ya) [and my comments certainly haven't made it any shorter],
but it's almost finished.  I believe 
I've covered most of the integral features of planwatch to get you started . 
[there's always <a href='/help'>help</a> if you need it, from a link at the top of every page.]
<br><br>
If you have any questions at all, email josh at
<a href='mailto:help@planwatch.org'>help@planwatch.org</a>
(he's the man who created it [note that madvani is also working on it now] ).
Feel free to write him about 
anything puzzling you regarding all this new schtuff.  If you are using 
planworld, there is a <a href='/help'>help section</a> regarding a few things.  Also, I'm always 
willing to lend a helping hand if you don't understand anything.
