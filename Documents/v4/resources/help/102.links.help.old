	$title="Intro Formatting: Plan Links";
	$body="##Plan Links
When you mention another user in your plan, putting their name inside &#33;s will create a link
to their plan. This lets people who read you click on their name to read their plan, and it
gives them a 'snoop' to let them know you're saying something to them (or about them).<br>
Examples:
> &#33;jwdavidson! becomes !jwdavidson!
> &#33;jlodom00@note! becomes !jlodom00@note!


#Alias Links
If you use <a href='/help/watched#aliases'>watched list aliases</a>, you can refer to users by their watched list alias instead
of their actual user name. This is most useful for RSS plans. For instance, if i watched
the slashdot RSS feed (http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rss) and aliased it as 'slash' in my
watched list, this example would create a link:
> &#33;slash! becomes <a href='/read/http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rss'>slash</a>

<b>Web links</b>
You can link to websites using the same format, so these examples will also work:<br>
<blockquote>
&#33;http://www.blah.com/:website title&#33; becomes !http://www.blah.com/:website title!
</blockquote>

<b>Links with descriptions</b><br>
You can add some descriptive text to a link after a colon. This text will show up as the link 
text instead of the username or website the link points to. These demonstrate:<br>
<blockquote>
&#33;link:http://www.blah.com/:blah! becomes !link:http://www.blah.com/:blah!<br>
&#33;jwdavidson:josh is a really cool guy&#33; becomes !jwdavidson:josh is a really cool guy!
</blockquote>
